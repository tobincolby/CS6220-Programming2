"In the class I talk to students about how our minds lie to us," Santos said. "They tell us if I want to be happy, I need to change my circumstances, I need a new job, or a better salary or I need to move. Really you just have to change your mindset. Your circumstances are fine. It's kind of how you react to them."

Instead of regular homework, students in Santos' class see requirements on their syllabus to take exams instead of it.
