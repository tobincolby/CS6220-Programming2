Union membership across the United States has been on a slow decline over the last 70 years. More recently, however, labor strikes have had a resurgence. In this lesson, students will consider the reasons unions and workers strike, examine the causes of the present conflict between the United Automobile Workers and General Motors, and, finally, act as negotiators to resolve the impasse.

Warm Up

What do you know about labor unions? Do you have a favorable opinion of them? Do you think they help workers to secure and protect important rights and benefits? Do you believe they benefit the country and its economy as a whole?

At their peak in 1954, 34.8 percent of all United States wage and salary workers belonged to unions. Their power and prestige has been declining slowly, however, and membership dropped to only 10.5 percent in 2018.

In the last two years, however, there has been a resurgence in union strikes throughout the country: Teachers in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Kentucky; hotel workers at nearly two dozen Marriott hotels; and grocery employees at Stop & Shop locations in the Northeast have all gone on strike, many successfully.
On Monday, the United Automobile Workers went on strike at General Motors, sending nearly 50,000 members at factories across the Midwest and South to picket lines, continuing the trend.

First, make a list of reasons you think workers and unions choose to strike.

Next, look at these photos and captions of striking autoworkers. Respond in writing or discuss with your classmates:
